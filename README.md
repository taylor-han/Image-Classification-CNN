# Image-Classification-CNN
 Neural networks and deep learning algorithms have been
acknowledged for demonstrating their strengths in predicting
multi-class outputs given original multi-dimensional inputs.
This project attempts to create the optimal convolutional neural
network for the CIFAR-10 dataset using the neural networks
library Keras. A varying selection of filters, activation
functions, pooling functions, and optimizers were tried for the
learning algorithm. The functionality of each learning
algorithm was determined using their corresponding test
accuracies, and the algorithm that produced the highest test
accuracy is considered to be the optimal convolutional neural
network.
